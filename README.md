# odin-library

### Overview

The goal of this project is to create a small Library application that allows users to manage a collection of books. The app will enable users to add, display, and manipulate book information.

### Key Features

- **Book Creation**: Users can create new book objects with attributes such as author, title, number of pages, and read status.
- **Display Books**: The app will loop through an array of books and display them on the page, either as a table or individual cards.
- **New Book Form**: A form will be presented to users for adding new books, which includes fields for all necessary details.
- **Remove Books**: Each book displayed will have a button to remove it from the library.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can change the read status of each book with a dedicated button.

**_This is just a simple front-end project._**
